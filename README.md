# Hi there, I'm rtorval ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Senior Software & Infrastructure Engineer** based in **Asturies, Spain**.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on deepening my skills to make a solid impact in the IT sector. Iâ€™m also on a personal journey to build a stable and meaningful life with my family â€” ideally somewhere close to nature, embracing a simpler and more sustainable lifestyle.

Not everything I do is about code â€” Iâ€™ve built a **column still**, I enjoy **cooking**, **gardening**, **climbing**, **hiking**, and occasionally play the **guitar**.
